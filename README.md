# Deep learning Jeju camp 2018

* This project is built during '[Deep Learning Jeju Camp](http://jeju.dlcamp.org)' in 2018.
* This project is currently under construction. 

## Objective

The goal of this project is controlling multi-agents using graph neural networks. Multi-agent scenarios are usually sparsely rewarded. Graph neural networks have an advantage that each node can be trained robustly. With this property, we hypothesized that each agent in an environment can be controlled individually. Since there have been many research papers related to graph neural networks, we would like to apply it to reinforcement learning.

For the experiment, we will use [Pommerman](https://www.pommerman.com) environment. This has relatively strict constraints on environment settings and simple to deploy algorithms.
