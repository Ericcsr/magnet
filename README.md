# Deep learning Jeju camp 2018

This project has been researched during 'deep learning Jeju camp' in 2018.

## Objective

The goal of this project is training multi-agents using graph neural networks. Graph neural networks has advantage of more robustly train each nodes. By this intuition, we would like to adopt graph networks to reinforcement learning to control multi-agents.
